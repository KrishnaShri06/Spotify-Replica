# Spotify-Replica
Author : Krishna Shrivastav
<br>
This project is a static clone of the Spotify web player built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the core layout and design of Spotify, including a sidebar navigation, music library section, featured playlist cards, and a media player at the bottom. The interface is fully responsive and styled using modern CSS techniques like Flexbox, with icons from Font Awesome and fonts from Google Fonts. Although it's not functional for playing music, it effectively showcases UI/UX design skills and front-end layout structure. All content is static and intended for visual demonstration. This project is ideal for learning or showcasing front-end development capabilities.
